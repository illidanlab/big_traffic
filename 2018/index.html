	      <h2>BigTraffic 2018</h2>
	      <p>1<sup>st</sup> International Workshop on Big Traffic Data Analytics</p>
	    </header>
	    <p><b>In conjunction with <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm18/" target="blank">18th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2018)</a><br />
		May 3 - 5, 2018, San Diego, California, USA</b></p>
	    
	    <p>The proposed workshop (BigTraffic) aims to bring the attention of researchers to the various data mining and machine learning methods for traffic studies, and therefore promote AI research. The availability of massive amount of travel data has provided unique opportunities for data-driven intelligent transportation systems. Even though traffic patterns are extensively studied from both the marcoscopic traffic level (e.g., urban traffic patterns) and microscropic traffic level (e.g., behavior of individual drivers/vehicles), the small-scale data used in prior studies has greatly restricted the complexity of models and thus the capability of capturing complicated dynamics in traffic patterns. The availability of big traffic data has enabled a wide spectrum of powerful machine learning and data mining methodologies to be applied to traffic studies.

	    <h4>Topics of Interest</h4>
	    <p>We encourage submissions on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:</p>
	    <ul class="feature-icons2">
	      <li class="fa-lightbulb-o">Novel machine learning algorithms for traffic studies, e.g., new trajectory analysis algorithms, new traffic state estimation algorithms, new data-driven algorithms for map matching. 
	      </li>
	      <li class="fa-paper-plane">Novel approaches for applying existing machine learning algorithms, e.g., applying bilinear models, sparse learning, metric learning, neural networks and deep learning, for traffic studies. 
	      </li>
	      <li class="fa-rocket">Novel optimization algorithms and analysis for improving traffic data processing, e.g., parallel/distributed optimization techniques and efficient stochastic gradient descent. 
	      </li>
	      <li class="fa-gears">Industrial practices and implementations of big traffic data modeling, e.g., feature engineering, model ensemble, and lessons from large-scale implementations of intelligent transportation systems.
