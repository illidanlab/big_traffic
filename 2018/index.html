	      <h2>BigTraffic 2018</h2>
	      <p>1<sup>st</sup> International Workshop on Big Traffic Data Analytics</p>
	    </header>
	    <p><b>In conjunction with <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm18/" target="blank">18th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2018)</a><br />
		May 3 - 5, 2018, San Diego, California, USA</b></p>
	    
	    <p>The proposed workshop (BigTraffic) aims to bring the attention of researchers to the various data mining and machine learning methods for traffic studies, and therefore promote AI research. The availability of massive amount of travel data has provided unique opportunities for data-driven intelligent transportation systems. Even though traffic patterns are extensively studied from both the marcoscopic traffic level (e.g., urban traffic patterns) and microscropic traffic level (e.g., behavior of individual drivers/vehicles), the small-scale data used in prior studies has greatly restricted the complexity of models and thus the capability of capturing complicated dynamics in traffic patterns. The availability of big traffic data has enabled a wide spectrum of powerful machine learning and data mining methodologies to be applied to traffic studies. 
	      <br>

			      	<b>Abstract:</b> 
			      	Large-scale traffic data can be collected from mobile phones, car navigation systems, road surveillance cameras, and loop sensors. Turning such raw data into knowledge can provide insights about our city and empower the city to be more intelligent. In this talk, I would like to share new data mining and machine learning technologies to addressing challenges in travel demand prediction, travel time estimation, and intelligent traffic signal control. In addition, I would like to share an opportunity of City Brain project, which I will soon start working on from summer 2018. This project will be in collaboration with traffic police department of Hangzhou, China. We will be exploring AI-empowered data-driven traffic signal control system. I am looking for potential collaborations on city brain project.<br />

			      	<b>Title:</b> Mobile Route Recommendations for Intelligent Transportation Services (<a href="#" target="blank">slides</a>)<br />
			      	<b>Abstract:</b> 
			      	The accumulated large amount of mobility data and the ability to track moving people or objects have enabled us to develop advanced mobile recommendations, which are essentially to recommend a sequence of locations to an individual user on the move. In this talk, we study a particular case of mobile recommendations, mobile route recommendation (MRR), by utilizing GPS data. The goal of MRR is to recommend a sequence of locations to a driver based on his current location in order to maximize his business success. To make our recommendation practical and scalable for real practice, we need to produce the recommendation results in a timely fashion once a request emerges. Therefore, we develop smart algorithms to efficiently generate recommendations. Furthermore, we identify and address the cold start challenge of MRR (CS-MRR). We develop a dedicated and efficient algorithm for the CS-MRR problem. The package of solutions for both MRR and CS-MRR problems provides a complete approach for route recommendations to drivers. We evaluate our methods using both real-world GPS data and synthetic data, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed methods with different validation metrics and the improved business performance by our recommendations.<br />
